**Daedal** â€” is a carefully crafted multi-purpose, responsive, and gorgeous theme that showcases a clean interface for a sharp user experience. Built with Vue CLI, it comes with all of the tools that you need to start developing your application *right now.*  **Daedal** has professional, pixel perfect, and clean modern layouts with over *50* custom components and *8* pre-made views that compliment any use-case.

**Vuetify** is the number one component library for Vue and has been in active development since 2016. The goal of the project is to provide users with everything that is needed to build rich and engaging web applications using the [Material Design specification](https://material.io/guidelines/). It accomplishes that with a consistent update cycle, Long-term Support (LTS) for previous versions, responsive community engagement, a vast ecosystem of resources and a dedication to quality components.

## Getting Started
You will need a Windows, Mac, or Linux computer with access to the command-line and permission to install new system packages. An active internet connection is required in order to install the following required software:

* Node https://nodejs.org/en/
* NPM https://www.npmjs.com/
* Yarn https://yarnpkg.com/
* Vue CLI https://cli.vuejs.org/

Using the terminal, navigate to the folder containing the unzipped theme and run the `yarn` command. This will install all of the required packages and prepare your project for local development and production deployment. Once complete, type `yarn dev` and press the <kbd>enter</kbd> key. Vue CLI will then compile the project and serve a local server located at http://localhost:8080.
